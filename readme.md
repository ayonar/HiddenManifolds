#### Hidden Monifolds in Low Dimensional Space

Testing SPUD on artificially constructed noisy data.

Run HiddenManifold.ipynb from /spud_code/manifold_and_decoding/

Coming: *Due to the way SPUD code is written, it cannot be called as package as it is. I am rewriting parts related to path calls etc. to be able to use as a package. For now any run function need to be called within /manifold_and_decoding/*
